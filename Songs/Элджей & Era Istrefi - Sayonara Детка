[Intro: Era Istrefi & Элджей]
A-ya-ya-yai
A-ya-ya-ya-yai
Sayonara Boy
Sayonara Boy
A-ya-ya-yai
Aaah, aaah

[Hook: Era Istrefi]
Baby, tell me how last week you were leaving this
Now you hit me back saying that you still believe in us
I ain't tryna waste my time
You had me once, you ain’t gonna get it twice
Baby, tell me how last week you were leaving this
Now you're on your knees, acting like you always needed it
I ain't tryna waste my time
You had me once, you ain’t gonna get it twice
Not tonight, baby

[Verse 1: Элджей]
Детка, ты же меня знаешь. Я постоянно занят
Думаю о делах даже с закрытыми глазами
Ты снова набираешь, никто не отвечает
Я больше не верю обещаниям
Светофоры, светофоры, а я еду к себе домой
В розовой i-восьмой довольный и молодой
Не надо плакать в трубку, всё будет хорошо
Я вернул тебя туда где нашёл

[Hook: Era Istrefi]
Baby, tell me how last week you were leaving this
Now you hit me back saying that you still believe in us
I ain't tryna waste my time
You had me once, you ain't gonna get it twice
Baby, tell me how last week you were leaving this
Now you're on your knees, acting like you always needed it
I ain't tryna waste my time
You had me once, you ain't gonna get it twice
Not tonight, baby

[Verse 2: Элджей]
Детка, мы больше не знакомы (не знакомы)
Перестань караулить меня возле дома (возле дома)
Удали песни и все фотки с телефона (теле)
Закинься галоперидолом, и, наконец, оставь меня в покое
Лечу по Москве как супергерой
В тачке без номеров жую резинку Dirol
Я больше ничей, я больше не твой
Sayonara детка, это Sayonara Boy

[Hook: Era Istrefi]
Baby, tell me how last week you were leaving this
Now you hit me back saying that you still believe in us
I ain't tryna waste my time
You had me once, you ain't gonna get it twice
Baby, tell me how last week you were leaving this
Now you’re on your knees, acting like you always needed it
I ain’t tryna waste my time
You had me once, you ain't gonna get it twice
Oh baby

Aaah aaah

[Hook: Era Istrefi]
Baby, tell me how last week you were leaving this
Now you hit me back saying that you still believe in us
I ain't tryna waste my time
You had me once, you ain't gonna get it twice
Baby, tell me how last week you were leaving this
You need your knees
I ain't tryna waste my time
You had me once, you ain't gonna get it twice
Not tonight baby

[Verse 1: Aljay]
Baby, you know me. I am constantly busy
I think about things even with my eyes closed
You dial again, no one answers
I no longer believe promises
Traffic lights, traffic lights, and I'm going to my home
In the pink i-eighth, contented and young
Do not cry into the phone, everything will be fine
I brought you back to where I found

[Hook: Era Istrefi]
Baby, tell me how last week you were leaving this
Now you hit me back saying that you still believe in us
I ain't tryna waste my time
You had me once, you ain't gonna get it twice.
Baby, tell me how last week you were leaving this
You need your knees
I ain't tryna waste my time
You had me once, you ain't gonna get it twice.
Not tonight baby

[Verse 2: Aljay]
Baby, we are no longer familiar (not familiar)
Stop guarding me near the house (near the house)
Delete the songs and all the pictures from the phone (body)
Lay down haloperidol, and finally leave me alone
I fly in Moscow as a superhero
In the car without numbers zhuy gum Dirol
I am no more, I am no longer yours
Sayonara babe, this is Sayonara Boy

[Hook: Era Istrefi]
Baby, tell me how last week you were leaving this
Now you hit me back saying that you still believe in us
I ain't tryna waste my time
You had me once, you ain't gonna get it twice.
Baby, tell me how last week you were leaving this
Now you’re on your knees
I ain’t tryna waste my time
You had me once, you ain't gonna get it twice.
Oh baby
