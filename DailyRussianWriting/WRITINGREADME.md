# What this is

This is a section for me to see my progress in writing in the Russian Language

It will keep me in check, making sure I practice everyday

This will begin hopefully in August, 
once I have a better grasp of the alphabet and language



## What to do within this folder

Try to find a way to get the Russian alphabet typable

The easiest fix would be install driver for 
Russian keyboard and create file for shortcuts
