## What this is
In November 2017, I stumbled upon many Russian songs and I really liked the sound of them
The way the language flows with the music is really interesting, so I began to listen to more
Eventually I created a youtube playlist so that I could listen to these songs
Later my friends also emjoyed the songs and asked me to make a spotify playlist which I am still working on/updating
This repository will have information about each of the songs 
in which I hope to learn the Russian language when trying to understand the lyrics

## Where this idea comes from
The idea for this repository/project came from many GitHub users who create repositories/projects about their daily routines
I saw some working out, reading books, etc.
Since I enjoy these songs and want to learn a new language from my native Polish and English
I decided to create this project so that I can learn
Especially since Russian is an entirely new alphabet
I also hope that someone may stumble upon this project and begin to like these songs and try to learn the language
If they do not, that is okay
Music is unique for everyone

## Once done hope for
A decription of what the songs mean
A line for line translation
A github pages page for visual effect

If a hit, I will repeat the process for more languages
